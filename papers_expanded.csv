This thesis aims to enhance the capabilities of smartphone-based biometric recognition and health monitoring systems through the analysis of human behavioral information acquired from the smartphone’s built-in sensors. The objective is to develop efficient approaches for biometric authentication, gender recognition, and physical activity recognition. The proposed approach for user authentication utilizes behavioral data collected while the user performs different gestures during interaction with the device, using the modified Hausdorff distance (MHD) for matching features of the gestures. For gender recognition, two methods are presented: one that captures behavioral information while the user interacts with the smartphone’s touchscreen and another that uses gait information collected using built-in sensors in the smartphone. The thesis also presents an approach to recognize various physical activities performed by the user using accelerometer and gyroscope sensor signals.","> smartphones, human behavior, biometric authentication, gesture recognition, gender recognition, physical activity recognition, accelerometer sensor, gyroscope sensor, orientation sensor"

- Endowed with context-awareness and proactive capabilities, caching users’ content locally at the edge of the network is able to cope with increasing data traffic demand in 5G wireless networks. In this work, we focus on the energy consumption aspects of cache-enabled wireless cellular networks, specifically in terms of area power consumption (APC) and energy efficiency (EE). We assume that both base stations (BSs) and mobile users are distributed according to homogeneous Poisson point processes (PPPs) and we introduce a detailed power model that takes into account caching. We study the conditions under which the area power consumption is minimized with respect to BS transmit power, while ensuring a certain quality of service (QoS) in terms of coverage probability. Furthermore, we provide the optimal BS transmit power that maximizes the area spectral efficiency per unit total power spent.","5G, mobile wireless networks, caching, energy efficiency, area power consumption, stochastic geometry"

The paper focuses on the issue of joining decomposed fuzzy relations in fuzzy relational databases, which undergo decomposition during normalization. The authors define fuzzy join dependency in the context of type-1 and type-2 fuzzy relational databases using fuzzy functions and the fuzzy equi-join operator for computing fuzzy equality. They discuss the dependency preservation property on execution of this fuzzy equi-join, derive necessary conditions for the fuzzy functional dependencies to be preserved on joining decomposed fuzzy relations, derive conditions for fuzzy join dependency to exist in both types of databases, and find that even a trivial join dependency does not ensure lossless join decomposition in type-2 fuzzy relational databases.","Fuzzy - equi join, fuzzy functions, fuzzy join dependency, type-1 fuzzy relational database, type-2 fuzzy relational database"

The weights assigned are betweenness and closeness centrality of an entity.

Background Clickbaits are online articles with deliberately designed misleading titles for luring more and more readers to open the intended web page. Methodology A total of one hundred thousand article headlines are collected from news aggregator sites consists of clickbaits and authentic news headlines. The collected data samples are divided into five training sets of balanced and unbalanced data. The natural language processing techniques are used to extract 19 manually selected features from article headlines. Contribution Three ensemble learning techniques including bagging, boosting, and random forests are used to design a classifier model for classifying a given headline into the clickbait or non-clickbait. The performances of learners are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measures. Findings It is observed that the random forest classifier detects clickbaits better than the other classifiers with an accuracy of 91.16 %, a total precision, recall, and f-measure of 91 %.","authentic news, clickbaits, ensemble learning, natural language processing, performance measures"

The experimental results reveal that ABC algorithm performs best for majority of the problems on high dimension, while on small dimension, CS is the best choice. FPA attains the next best position followed by BA and FA for all kinds of functions. Self-adaptation of these algorithms also reveals the best values of input parameters for various algorithms, which may aid experts in solving intricate optimization problems.","Artiﬁcial bee colony algorithm, CEC2014 benchmark functions, Computational time complexity, Wilcoxon rank sum test, Convergence rate"

Dataset\Dr.Manpreet Kaur\Entailment and spectral clustering based single and multiple document summarization.pdf,Entailment and Spectral Clustering based Single and Multiple Document Summarization,Anand Gupta,"Text connectedness is an important feature for content selection in text summarization methods. Recently, Textual Entailment (TE) has been successfully employed to measure sentence connectedness in order to determine sentence salience in single document text summarization. The method, Analog Textual Entailment and Spectral Clustering (ATESC), uses TE to compute inter-sentence connectedness scores, which are used to compute the salience of sentences and are further utilized by Spectral Clustering algorithm to create segments of sentences. Finally, the most salient sentences are extracted from the most salient segments for inclusion in the final summary. The method has shown good performance earlier, but the authors observe that TE has never been employed for the task of multi-document summarization. Therefore, this paper proposes ATESC based new methods for the same task. The experiments conducted on DUC 2003 and 2004 datasets reveal that the notion of Textual Entailment along with Spectral Clustering algorithm proves to be an effective duo for redundancy removal and generating informative summaries in multi-document summarization.

Two strategies are adopted: single level strategy using the Cheng and Church (CC) algorithm, and a two-level clustering strategy combining CC with K-Means clustering. The analysis reveals that the single level strategy is useful for experienced users, while the two-level strategy is better suited for beginners.","Biclustering, e-governance, single levels strategy, two level strategy"

In this work, the class of Jf implications with respect to three classical logic tautologies, viz., distributivity, law of importation, and contrapositive symmetry are explored. Necessary and sufficient conditions under which Jf implications are distributive over t-norms and t-conorms, and satisfy the law of importation with respect to a t-norm have been presented. Conditions for the natural negations of Jf implications to become strong and possess contrapositive symmetry with respect to their natural negations have also been given. When the natural negations of Jf are not strong, the contrapositivisation of Jf is discussed. Additionally, a new class of implications called h-generated implications, Jh, has been proposed, and the interplay between these two types of implications has been studied.","Yager’s Implications, f-Generated implications, Distributivity of fuzzy implications, Law of importation, Contrapositive symmetry, Contrapositivisation, h-Generated implications"

> ""The reservoir characterization aims to provide the analysis and quantification of the injection-production relationship, which is the fundamental work for production management. The connectivity between injectors and producers is dominated by geological properties, especially permeability. However, the permeability parameters are very heterogenous in oil reservoirs, and expensive to collect by well logging. The commercial simulators enable to get accurate simulation but require sufficient geological properties and consume excessive computation resources. In contrast, the data-driven models (physical models and machine learning models) are developed on the observed dynamic data, such as the rate and pressure data of the injectors and producers, constructing the connectivity relationship and forecasting the productivity by a series of nonlinear mappings or the control of specific physical principles. While, due to the ‘black box’ feature of machine learning approaches, and the constraints and assumptions of physical models, the data-driven methods often face the challenges of poor interpretability and generalizability and the limited application scopes. To solve these issues, integrating the physical principle of the waterflooding process (material balance equation) with an artificial neural network (ANN), a knowledge interaction neural network (KINN) is proposed. KINN consists of three transparent modules with explicit physical significance, and different modules are joined together via the material balance equation and work cooperatively to approximate the waterflooding process. In addition, a gate function is proposed to distinguish the dominant flowing channels from weak connecting ones by their sparsity, and thus the inter-well connectivity can be indicated directly by the model parameters. Combining the strong nonlinear mapping ability with the guidance of physical knowledge, the interpretability of KINN is fully enhanced, and the prediction accuracy on the well productivity is improved. The effectiveness of KINN is proved by comparing its performance with the canonical ANN, on the inter-well connectivity analysis and productivity forecast tasks of three synthetic reservoir experiments.

Strong authentication schemes can be applied to wired networks. Wireless networks on the other hand suffer from packet losses and bit errors, often have low bandwidth and have resource constraints such as computation overhead and storage. In the present work, we present a two-stage authentication scheme for wireless networks that uses a computationally intensive but highly secure strong authentication in Stage 1 and a lightweight symmetric key based protocol in Stage 2. The cost of the strong authentication adopted in Stage 1 is amortized over N sessions thus reducing the overall cost of the scheme.

> ""Depletion in estrogen level(s) especially in postmenopausal women is reported to have delayed wound healing effects; hence we have evaluated the wound healing potential of raloxifene in rat model. The optimized nanoemulsion gel contains 0.072% raloxifene hydrochloride. Female Wistar rats were used to investigate its wound healing effects. After three months of ovariectomy, wound healing effect was observed in terms of breaking strength, tensile strength, area of wound contraction, wound closure time, hydroxyproline content and histopathological changes. The nanoemulsion gel exhibited better retention (34.31%) than its nanoemulsion. The raloxifene nanoemulsion gel has no erythema and no eschar formation recorded, and it is safe for topical use. In the incision wound model in ovariectomized rats, breaking (898±25g) and tensile strengths (4.47±0.12 g/mm2) in raloxifene treated groups were found to be higher than the untreated control group. Additionally, in ovariectomized rats, wound contraction was found to be 100% in the treated group s following 20 days of post-wounding, where as in control group only 88% was contraction was observed.

Preconditioned iterative methods introduce errors in linear solves because they are not exact. We prove that, under mild conditions, the AIRGA algorithm is backward stable with respect to the errors introduced by these inexact linear solves. Our first assumption is use of a Ritz-Galerkin based solver that satisfies few extra orthogonality conditions. Since Conjugate Gradient (CG) is the most popular method based upon the Ritz-Galerkin theory, we use it. We show how to modify CG to achieve these extra orthogonalities. Modifying CG with the suggested changes is non-trivial. Hence, we demonstrate that using Recycling CG (RCG) helps us achieve these orthogonalities with no code changes. The extra cost of orthogonalizations is often offset by savings because of recycling. While satisfying the backward stability assumptions, by numerical experiments we show that as we iteratively solve the linear systems arising in the AIRGA algorithm more accurately, we obtain a more accurate reduced system. Experiments are done on an one dimensional beam model and a Gyroscope model, both of which give rise to Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) linear systems (as needed because of use of CG/RCG). Since Sparse Approximate Inverse (SPAI) and Incomplete Cholesky Factorization (ICHOL) are the most general types of preconditioners, we use both here. By numerical experiments, we also show that recycling Krylov subspaces helps satisfy the backward stability assumptions (extra-orthogonalities) at almost no extra cost.","Model Order Reduction, Global Arnoldi Algorithm, Moment Matching, Iterative Methods, Preconditioners, Backward Stability Analysis, Recycling Krylov Subspaces, Recycling CG"

Many popular web servers on the Internet are generous as they wait for a substantial time period to receive the remaining portion of an incomplete web request, but this behavior makes them vulnerable to Slow Rate DoS attacks, especially in the context of HTTP/2. To bridge the gaps, this work tests the behavior of HTTP/2 supporting web servers against Slow HTTP/2 DoS attacks and proposes a scheme to detect these attacks in real-time with high accuracy and minimal computational overhead.","HTTP/2, Slow Rate DoS attacks, Anomaly detection, DoS"

First, we describe new threat vectors of HTTP/2, including Slow Rate DoS attacks, which can be launched by injecting specially crafted HTTP requests. We empirically evaluate these attacks against popular web servers and report that the majority are vulnerable to them. The effectiveness of the proposed attacks was tested using both clear text and encrypted HTTP/2 requests, and it was found that the attack is effective independent of the request type.

Dataset\Nikhil Tripathi\Slow Rate Denial of Service Attacks.pdf,Slow Rate Denial of Service Attacks Against HTTP/2 and Detection,Neminath Hubballi,"> HTTP/2 is a newly standardized protocol compared to HTTP/1.1, and our contribution in this paper is threefold. First, we describe new threat vectors of HTTP/2, including Slow Rate DoS attacks, which can be launched by injecting specially crafted HTTP requests. We empirically evaluate these attacks against popular web servers and report that the majority are vulnerable to them. The effectiveness of the proposed attacks was tested using both clear text and encrypted HTTP/2 requests, and it was found that the attack is effective independent of the request type. Second, we compare structurally similar attacks with HTTP/1.1 and report that HTTP/2 has more threat vectors compared to its predecessor.

This has necessitated the need for a clean, eco-friendly, and efficient source of energy. Biogas is identified as such a source, but its efficiency needs improvement. The study employs the water scrubbing technique combined with the use of an adsorbent like molecular sieve for biogas purification. Alkaline water scrubbing is used to remove carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide more efficiently than normal water scrubbing, increasing the concentration of methane which facilitates easy packing, carriage, and storage of biogas, thereby enhancing its utility as a fuel.","Biogas, Combined Method, Alkaline Water Scrubbing, Adsorption Through Carbon Molecular Sieve"

The preprocessed protein sequences are used as an input in two clustering algorithms, Scalable Random Sampling with Iterative Optimization Fuzzy c-Means (SRSIO-FCM) and Scalable Literal Fuzzy C-Means (SLFCM), for clustering. Experiments on various soybean protein datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed feature extraction methods, 60d-SPF, 6d-SCPSF, and existing feature extraction methods on SRSIO-FCM and SLFCM clustering algorithms.","Apache Spark, Cluster, Big Data, Feature Extraction, Fuzzy Clustering, Huge Protein Sequences, Scalable Algorithms"

EM provides a statistical model for data handling, while addressing measurement and representation uncertainties. Rough-set theory improves performance by faster convergence and avoiding local minima issues. Fuzzy-correlation-based gray-level thresholding is used for rule generation in rough-set theory, and MST is employed to determine nonconvex clusters. This method requires minimal time due to being applied on Gaussians determined by granules rather than original data points.

The model helps in probabilistically forecasting fires to aid forest department planning. Due to practical problems, most of the collected data have 80% attributes missing and are hard to discretize. To adapt to such limitations, nominal data type is used, which allows better understanding of temporal and spatial features. Practical limitations include rare forest fire events and high cost of manual classification, along with an unbalanced problem distribution and grouping of examples into batches from satellite photography and national park reports. The second dataset was collected from meteorological weather stations. The compiled task serves as a filter to allow users to vary the false alarm rate. Regression analysis shows that the forest fire classifier has a minimum false alarm rate when including temporal features.","Machine Learning, Data Mining, Naive Bayes, Forest Fires, Fire Weather Index (FWI), Temporal Patterns, WEKA machine learning framework."

Introduction:
Blood banks play a crucial role in the healthcare system as they store and distribute blood and blood products to hospitals for transfusions. The management of blood banks is complex due to various factors such as the perishable nature of blood, the need for compatibility between donors and recipients, and the importance of maintaining sterile conditions. This paper presents an efficient Database Management System (DBMS) for a blood bank that aims to streamline the process of managing blood and blood products, improving the overall efficiency of the system.

Methodology:
The proposed DBMS includes various features such as notifications to donors when they are eligible to donate, secure and anonymous chat with donors, different authorization rights for hospitals, blood banks, doctors, and donors, and an application for donors to receive SMS alerts about blood donation camps. The system also allows hospitals to contact donors in case of emergencies, request blood directly from the blood bank via the application, and shows the nearest blood bank.

Results:
The DBMS was designed and implemented using MySQL as the database management system and PHP as the server-side scripting language. The system was tested for functionality and efficiency, and it was found to be effective in managing blood and blood products in a blood bank. A comparative analysis was performed with previously published works, confirming the efficacy of the proposed method.

Discussion:
The proposed DBMS addresses various challenges faced by blood banks such as maintaining accurate records of donors and recipients, ensuring the compatibility between donors and recipients, managing the perishable nature of blood, and maintaining sterile conditions. The system also improves the overall efficiency of the blood bank by streamlining the process of managing blood and blood products.

Conclusion:
The proposed DBMS for a blood bank is an efficient solution for managing blood and blood products in a blood bank. The system includes various features such as notifications to donors, secure and anonymous chat with donors, different authorization rights for hospitals, blood banks, doctors, and donors, and an application for donors to receive SMS alerts about blood donation camps. Future scope includes developing a GUI-based application for easy access and installation in ambulances to save time, notifications before the expiry date of blood units, and an application for donors to get alerts when they become eligible to donate blood.

Introduction:
Blood banks play a crucial role in the healthcare system as they store and distribute blood and blood products to hospitals for transfusions. The management of blood banks is complex due to various factors such as the perishable nature of blood, the need for compatibility between donors and recipients, and the importance of maintaining sterile conditions. This paper presents an efficient Database Management System (DBMS) for a blood bank that aims to streamline the process of managing blood and blood products, improving the overall efficiency of the system.

Methodology:
The proposed DBMS includes various features such as notifications to donors when they are eligible to donate, secure and anonymous chat with donors, different authorization rights for hospitals, blood banks, doctors, and donors, and an application for donors to receive SMS alerts about blood donation camps. The system also allows hospitals to contact donors in case of emergencies, request blood directly from the blood bank via the application, and shows the nearest blood bank.

Results:
The DBMS was designed and implemented using MySQL as the database management system and PHP as the server-side scripting language. The system was tested for functionality and efficiency, and it was found to be effective in managing blood and blood products in a blood bank. A comparative analysis was performed with previously published works, confirming the efficacy of the proposed method.

Discussion:
The proposed DBMS addresses various challenges faced by blood banks such as maintaining accurate records of donors and recipients, ensuring the compatibility between donors and recipients, managing the perishable nature of blood, and maintaining sterile conditions. The system also improves the overall efficiency of the blood bank by streamlining the process of managing blood and blood products.

Conclusion:
The proposed DBMS for a blood bank is an efficient solution for managing blood and blood products in a blood bank. The system includes various features such as notifications to donors, secure and anonymous chat with donors, different authorization rights for hospitals, blood banks, doctors, and donors, and an application for donors to receive SMS alerts about blood donation camps. Future scope includes developing a GUI-based application for easy access and installation in ambulances to save time, notifications before the expiry date of blood units, and an application for donors to get alerts when they become eligible to donate blood.

Students are assessed to determine their inherent learning skills and after their assessment, students are paired up for collaborative learning. Two methods are employed: the Stable Marriages Problem and the recursive Kernighan-Lin partitioning algorithm to generate optimal collaborative pairs. Results reveal that both pairing algorithms generate high quality collaborative pairs and take lesser time to discover all possible pairs.","Collaborative Learning, Learning Skills, Kernighan Lin Algorithm, Stable Marriages Problem"

An overcomplete dictionary is constructed using the identity basis, cosine, and sine elementary waveforms to capture morphological components of the impulse noise and deterministic modulated signals effectively. The proposed method of modulation classification consists of three major steps: sparse signal decomposition on hybrid dictionaries, modulated signal extraction, and maximum likelihood based classification. The testing and validation of both direct ML and SSD-based ML classification methods are carried out under different Gaussian and impulse noise conditions for modulation classification.

Ravi\CUDA-Self-Organizing.pdf,CUDA-Self-Organizing feature map based visual sentiment analysis of bank customer complaints for Analytical CRM,Akhilesh Gangwar,"> With the widespread use of social media, companies now have access to a wealth of customer feedback data which has valuable applications to Customer Relationship Management (CRM). Analyzing customer grievances data is paramount as their speedy non-redressal would lead to customer churn resulting in lower profitability. In this paper, we propose a descriptive analytics framework using Self-organizing feature map (SOM), for Visual Sentiment Analysis of customer complaints. The network learns the inherent grouping of the complaints automatically which can then be visualized too using various techniques. Analytical Customer Relationship Management (ACRM) executives can draw useful business insights from the maps and take timely remedial action. We also propose a high-performance version of the algorithm CUDASOM (CUDA based Self Organizing feature Map) implemented using NVIDIA parallel computing platform, CUDA, which speeds up the processing of high-dimensional text data and generates fast results. The efficacy of the proposed model has been demonstrated on the customer complaints data regarding the products and services of four leading Indian banks. CUDASOM achieved an average speed up of 44 times.","Customer Complaints, Analytical CRM, Self-Organizing Map, CUDA, Visual Sentiment Analysis"

Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perceptron, and SVM to test a research model with fourteen independent variables  and a dependent variable (adoption). A survey was conducted and the results were analyzed using these techniques. Using Decision Trees the profile of the mobile banking adopter’s profile was identified. Comparing different machine learning techniques it was found that Decision Trees outperformed the Logistic Regression and Multilayer Perceptron and SVM. Out of all the techniques, Decision Tree is recommended for profiling studies because apart from obtaining high accurate results, it also yields ‘if–then’ classification rules. The classification rules provided here can be used to target potential customers to adopt mobile banking by offering them appropriate incentives.

Dataset\Vidhi Khanduja\Dynamic Watermark Injection in NOSQL databases.pdf,Dynamic Watermark Injection in NoSQL Databases,Vidhi Khanduja,"With the advent of gathering real time information, the need of Not Only SQL (NoSQL) databases has skyrocketed. No prior work is done on watermarked protection of such Schema-less databases. Traditional watermarking techniques cannot be applied as NoSQL databases are dynamically increasing and often have irregularities in schema. In this paper, a new perspective of embedding watermark into such databases is proposed. Watermark that acts as a signature is securely prepared for each tuple individually. The proposal deals with the issues by leveraging the flexible schema features provided by NoSQL database. A new attribute is dynamically injected into the tuple before inserting or updating it in database. Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that with even the slightest modification of up to 5% alteration in tuples, the watermark recreated from the suspected database changes by as much as 20%, thus facilitating immediate detection with localization up to tuple level in the database.","Fragile Watermarking, Tamper Detection, NoSQL databases, Big Data, Dynamic Watermark Injection"

In this dissertation, a mechanism is presented for proof of ownership and ownership identification based on the secure embedding of a robust imperceptible watermark in relational data. Watermarking problem of relational databases is formulated as a constrained optimization problem and Genetic and Bacterial Foraging Optimization algorithms are implemented to solve the optimization problem and to handle the constraints. Proposed watermarking technique is resilient to watermark synchronization errors because it uses a partitioning approach that does not require marker tuples. Watermark decoding is based on a threshold-based technique characterized by an optimal threshold that minimizes the probability of decoding errors. Experimental results have shown that technique proposed in this dissertation is resilient to tuple deletion, alteration, and insertion attacks.","> outsourced relational databases, proof of ownership, watermarking, genetic optimization, bacterial foraging optimization, watermark synchronization errors, partitioning approach, decoding errors, tuple deletion, alteration, insertion attacks."
